Process traffic between switched Layer-2 endpoints declared in <config>.

CONFIG FILE FORMAT:

  <config> contains a list of logical ports, each being a Layer-2
  endpoint. A port is an arbitrary app subnetwork connected to the switch
  through its 'rx' and 'tx' links. The <config> file is in Lua source
  format and returns a table mapping unique endpoint names to endpoint
  specifications:

      return { [<endpoint-name> = <endpoint-spec>,]* }

  Each endpoint-spec must declare at least one app and the endpoint's
  'rx' and 'tx' ports. Optionally, additional apps and links can be
  declared:

      endpoint-spec := { apps = { [<app-name> = <app-spec>,]+ }
                         rx = <destination>,
                         tx = <source>,
                         links = [{ [<linkspec>,]* }]

      app-spec := { <app-class>, <app-config> }

      app-class := "<module>/<class>"

      destination, source := "<app-name>.<port>"

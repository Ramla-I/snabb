  -c, --cpu <cpus>
                             Bind Vita processes to <cpus>. Must be a
                             comma-separated list of CPU identifiers.

Run Vita, configurable via `snabb config'. Refer to “--config-help” on how to
configure Vita.

Note that Vita needs super-user privileges to run as it needs unrestricted
access to hardware devices via DMA and system resources like hugepages. Vita
also requires a CPU that support AES-NI and AVX-2. It is also required to boot
Linux with the kernel parameter iommu=off for Snabb device drivers to function.

Vita will fork into five processes which individually handle key management,
outbound routing, inbound routing, encapsulation, and decapsulation. The
resulting processes can be bound to specific CPUs using the “--cpu” option in
the given order.

Example:
  vita --cpus 0,1,2,3,4
